# fft: FFT wrapper for CP2K

This package hosts the FFT operations  required by cp2k. The code is entirely written in
C and can be built stand-alone in order to provide be reusable by other projects.

This package offers the following main features:

- Local 1D, 2D and 3D FFTs
- Local and distributed FFTs using MPI
- Complex-to-complex, Real-to-complex and complex-to-real FFTs

Currently, this package has its own tiny reference backend (not well-performing) and a FFTW-based backends. This package currently supports FFTW-based backend by FFTW3, MKL and CUDA.

## Unit Test

The `fft_unittest.x` binary runs tests for the different components of this backend (local FFTs, MPI backends if supported by the library, redistribution routines, compound FFTs, additional features).

```shell
$ cd cp2k/src/fft
$ make
$ ./fft_unittest.x

$ ./grid_unittest.x

## FFT performance test

The `fft_perftest.x` binary runs performance tests for FFT sizes interesting for CP2K runs.
